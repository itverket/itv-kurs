# React + Redux api interaction
This exercise will give a short example of how a react app can be connected to a web api using axios and redux libraries.

If you are not at all familiar with react and concepts like jsx, props, component state, and component composition, it is recommended to first read the [Quick Start](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) article and do the [Intro To React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) tutorial, which will provide a good foundation.
