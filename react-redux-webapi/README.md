# React + Redux api interaction
This exercise will give a short example of how a react app can be connected to a web api using axios and redux libraries.

If you are not at all familiar with react and concepts like jsx, props, component state, and component composition, it is recommended to first read the [Quick Start](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) article and do the [Intro To React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) tutorial, which will provide a good foundation.


## Build wine list application
* Open `wine-app` directory in a terminal and run `yarn start` to run the development server. The app then be browsed at localhost:3000
* The app displays just a single page with a header. We want to connect it to an api serving wine data. The api might be unstable so we want to give the user a feel for what is happening while the data is fetched. 

### WineContainer component
Start by creating a new react component called `WineContainer` which will hold the data fetched from the API, as well as potential errors etc. 
The container component should only be responsible for holding the state and render other components. This pattern is used a lot when creating application using react, and will be usefull when we introduce redux later. [Read more](https://reactpatterns.com/#container-component).

Start with setting state in the constructor of the component, e.g. creating a 'searchedWine' property which we can populate with info about a wine. Start by hardcoding some values. Then render the info about the wine in the `render`-method of the component.

```javascript
constructor() {
  super();
  this.state = {
    searchedWine: {
      name: "Louis Max Hautes-CÃ´tes de Beaune 2015",
      vintage: "2015",
      country: "Frankrike"
    }
  };
}
```

```jsx
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{this.state.wine.name}</div>
      <div>{this.state.wine.vintage}</div>
      <div>{this.state.wine.country}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Check that the app render correctly in the browser, without errors.
Next create a `WineInfo` component and move the rendering of the wine info to this new component. 

The WineContainer components `render`-method should look something like this:

```jsx
render() {
  return (
    <div style={this.containerStyle}>
      <WineInfo wine={this.state.searchedWine} />
      <hr />
    </div>
  );
}
```

##Adding Redux
Instead of having the state of the application directly in the react container component we will use a immutable state container (redux). 

Go to `index.js` in src-directory, and wrap the `<App />` component in a provider component from react-redux.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./components/App";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { createStore } from "redux";

const initialState = {
  pageTitle: "Wine App"
};

const store = createStore(() => initialState, initialState);

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
``` 

This makes the redux state object available. Next we want to connect our react components to the redux state object. Go back to the `App`-component and connect it to redux.

The `connect`-function takes a function as parameter that maps from the state object to a new object that will be the `props` of the component.

```jsx
import { connect } from "./react-redux";

{/*.......*/}

const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {
    title: state.title
  };
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(App);
```

Replace the title with this props. It should be accessible through `this.props.pageTitle`.
